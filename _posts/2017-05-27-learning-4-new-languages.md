I come to you today as a changed man. A Ruby programmer that has been to the gates of Mordor and beyond, and lived to tell the tale.

But seriously, my brain hurts. While perusing through the Indeed pages looking for potential dream jobs and came across a posting where I felt confident enough to apply. They needed someone passionate about code and willing to learn new things. I thought I fit those requirements quite well.

Not long after applying I was happy to receive an email letting me know they were interested in learning more about me for the position, and sent over Part 1 of a 2-part coding challenge, and what a doozy it was.

The first part of the challenge involved building out fizzbuzz in the Haskell functional programming language. And that was only the first one. It seemed like a daunting task at first. I had seen Haskell before, during the early stages of my programming career and found it to be intruiging, but far too advanced for my skill level. Little did I know I would have to figure it out for a job application!

At first I had no idea what I was doing. I found a free book online called "Learn You a Haskell For Great Good!" and found it to be hilariously engaging. The author did a great job at explaining the basic concepts, but I did not have a few weeks to sit around and read the whole thing. This was a coding challenge and I told myself I had no other choice but to complete it by the end of the weekend. Which is when the frustration began...

I could not for the life of me figure out List Comprehensions and having to declare values before you even write the function. I was so used to Ruby and JavaScript doing all that for me implicitly and I took it all for granted!

After a few hours of Googling far and wide, I found a few stack overflow posts that were able to walk me through the functions I needed. My goal was to not comprehend the language as a whole, yet, but just enough to complete my challenge. I ended up hacking together a decent piece of code that was able to take in 3 variables, 2 for the FIZZ and BUZZ divisors, and the 3rd being the Upper bound of the range of numbers to be printed.

After being on a decent coding high from finally figuring out what I thought I was completely incapable of moments before, it was time to move onto the next challenge. The challenge involved solving for a palindrome (a word/phrase that is spelled the same backwards and forwards). A string would be passed to the program via Command Line Argument, if a palindrome was found, it needed to be returned in reverse lexical order. I had a couple choices of dynamically typed languages, I chose Python. Python had some pretty friendly syntax, not too far from Ruby, and it was actually the very first language I was exposed to in programming. Needless to say I knocked out that challenge within an hour.

I was required to complete the palindrome challenge in another, statically typed language. I ended up choosing Rust to work with. It reminded me alot of learning C during the Harvard CS course. You needed to declare value types for every function, and everything needed to be thrown in a main function. Rust documentation and Stack Overflow were my best friend for this challenge. And I think completing it made my brain grow 2 sizes that day.

Those were the main 3 challenges I had to complete, but there were "extra credit" challenges offered to complete, and who would I be without trying to take a stab at them.

The last challenge involved a bit of everything. Taking in a text file path via command line arguments, parsing the file of text line by line, and checking each line for a palindrome. If it was a palindrome, return "AY " followed by the palindrome in reverse lexical order. If it was not, return "NAY " and also returning the word in reverse lexical order. I ended up using Swift for the project because I had always been intrigued, and of course in awe of anything made by Apple.

8 hours later (according to my WakaTime summary) I was able to complete all the challenges along with some extra credit. I ended up having a pretty gnarly headache (LOL) by the end of it, but I'm so glad I finished it. I thought about giving up a couple times because I had no idea what I was doing but I refused to give up. I knew there was a way to work through the frustration and I found a groove between taking some breaks of fresh air and letting my mind absorb what I was trying to learn. It was a great experience and I can't wait to devote more of my time to learning these new (to me) languages in the future.
