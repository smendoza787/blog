This has been something in the back of my mind for a long time.

I've been teaching myself web development for about 8 months now and I think I've made tremendous progress on my own. I've been able to complete multiple tutorials, build up my portfolio with a few small projects, and I've really started to grasp the fundamentals of programming.

I've been able to make decent connections with a few meetups in my area, but my learning support system is not as strong as I would like it to be. I needed something to give me that extra push down the final stretch of my development journey and I decided that I needed to complete a serious curriculum.

Given my situation, the only feasible way to complete a course was through a learn at-your-own online program. After a ton of research, I narrowed it down to two programs: Flatiron School's Learn Verified and The Firehose Project.

I was able to test both of the platforms and I highly favored LV over TFP, both design-wise and teaching style. Although, I did really like the fact that TFP included a personal mentor and an agile project at the end.

But what stood out to me about Learn was the ability to ask a question at anytime through the universal chat that messaged all staff-mentors and other LV students. Whenever I got stuck I would always have my questions answered through there within (at the very latest) the hour. Also, the Job Guarantee they offer was pretty cool.

I'm hoping my prior experience will propel me through the program and I'll have a ton more experience to show employers. I should be starting in the next week and I'll be sure to update shortly after.
