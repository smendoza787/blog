So it has been about 3 months into my coding journey.

I would like to start off by saying I am having a blast learning to code, and I am beyond excited for the career and possible relocation opportunities that lie ahead. I have never felt so excited towards anything in my life, and that makes me feel amazing!

I had a rocky start at the beginning of my learning, I am afraid I was more interested in the “methods” of learning rather than learning the actual material. I guess I got a little bit of cold feet.

At first glance code looks SO intimidating. So many parenthesis and equal signs, astronomical looking numbers paired with so many different variables it literally made my head spin.

But as I am learning through the languages and immersing myself in everything tech, I am finding most concepts much easier to grasp. It gets a little frustrating coming into contact with your first bug or the first time your program doesn’t do exactly what you want it to do. But the wave of relief/excitement that you get when your program runs smoothly is so worth it!

I am learning more about myself and how to analyze every day situations as well. I never knew my habit of staying up until the wee hours relentlessly trying to get something on my computer to work would actually benefit me! Also, I think I am able to analyze situations in more detail. I can definitely feel my brain working harder and I love it.

I am still getting used to writing again since it has been about 4 years since I’ve been in school, but I am hoping to improve by just writing. No matter who ends up reading these, I can’t wait to check on my progress!
