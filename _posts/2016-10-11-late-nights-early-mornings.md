I have recently picked up back where I left off on freeCodeCamp a few months back.

I  had gone through the first few sections of FCC back in April but for some reason had stopped. Maybe I was going through a rough week at work or maybe I was just being lazy. For whatever reason I had stopped and did not resume until after all this Ruby craziness.

I have been FLYING through the Javascript section. It is such a fascinating language, and it almost feels more like a puzzle when I‚Äôm debugging rather than complete confusion and panic when it comes to Ruby. I know I have read everywhere that Ruby is the easiest to learn when it comes to beginners but so far I am really liking this new language.

One of the things I like about the course is that it takes on the format of having you read the new concept and immediately code for every new thing you learn. I prefer it much more over certain mooc videos because they will sometimes go 3 or 4 lessons deep until you actually practice something and the influx of information sometimes didn‚Äôt stay in my head as easily.

But one of the best things I like are the projects. I have browsed through some  previous FCC campers portfolio and I was impressed at what could be accomplished at that stage in the program.

Lately I have been putting in about 30 productive hours per week and am‚Ä¶.perplexed to be honest. I never thought anything could hold my attention for 30 hours, let alone after a 40 hour work week.

I believe I can do better at studying in distracting situations and my future self will probably want to shoot me but I promise I‚Äôll be making changes by the next blog post. üòâ

Lately I have been running into a couple ‚Äúlife‚Äù situations so I do need to set aside some time to handle that to benefit me in the long run but I just can‚Äôt stop thinking of code.

I am constantly trying to read up as much as I can and maximize the time I have away from my MacBook that I even bought a little keyboard for my iPad mini to bring to work with me and I‚Äôm so excited. I finally feel like I have a solid direction by following my interests and I am looking forward to the tough nights ahead.
