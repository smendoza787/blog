Like the title states, comments are something I‚Äôve always overlooked while developing my applications. Partly because I had no intentions of going in to refactor my code anytime soon, and partly because I‚Äôm really lazy lol.

A few days ago I chose to end my streak of lazy-ness and made it a point to try to comment as much as I could. What does this line do? Why am I making this for loop right here? I tried to express as much as I possibly could and go into considerable detail. I‚Äôm trying ( üòÇ ) to become a better writer so the more I write, the better.

For me, comments are important because:

1. They allow your code to be a lot more readable, which is huge when it comes to refactoring/updating old code, or if you plan on sharing your code with others
2. As you work through a problem it allows you to break down each section on the fly, so the problem is A LOT more clear than if you had just written plain code

As I‚Äôm heading into the era of the job application process I thought it would make sense to clean up some old code. As I was opening up some ‚Äúold‚Äù projects on CodePen I realized it was going to be very difficult to understand why I implemented certain features or components in certain places. Writing why you did something can be a huge help later to understand what sort of mindset you were in while you were working.

Another huge help that comments provide is a way to work out the problem you are working on, on the fly. When I first started coding I would try to work out as much of the problem out in my head first, then pick at my mental results and translate it into code. After a few months of that, I was starting to realize it was probably the wrong way and there had to have been better methods.

After a little googling about developer workflows I came to the conclusion that most devs write out as much as they know about the problem FIRST, then break it down into comments, and code from there.

This has proved invaluable to me because I can use all of my focus on one particular problem, instead of trying to work everything out in my head a little at a time and eventually forgetting almost everything.

I plan on commenting throughout ALL (or at least most) of my code from here on out and hope to reach a level where my explanations are much shorter. (I‚Äôm still working on condensing my thoughts into shorter bits of info, I like to ramble üò¶ )
