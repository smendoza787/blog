I've been fascinated by technology ever since my dad brought home our first desktop PC. It was a Sony Vaio, all grey monitor with the speakers built-in, a grey keyboard and a little grey tower.

I would always walk past the computers at Best Buy or Fry's and think they were the coolest contraptions I had ever seen. So many programs, so many activities, so many buttons.



I couldn't wait to come home and peck away at it, mess with the settings, change the wallpaper, or get lost on MSPaint. It was a huge upgrade from the old typewriter my parents would let me play with as a kid. I could even get lost for hours on the old "Windows Maze" screen saver that would come on every 5 minutes.

Fast forward a few years to high school and I had finally gotten my first job. Saved up a bit and had enough to buy my own Mac Mini. It was pretty much game over for me at that point.

In the days of pre-MySpace and Facebook I had a Xanga account, which was just a simple blogging platform that let you customize the HTML and CSS a bit. Updating the layout of my Xanga page became an obsession. I would spend hours browsing through different themes and tricks to make your cursor look different on the page and would spend even more time in Photoshop designing banners for my blog.

Some people even payed me to create custom MySpace layouts for them. I had no real idea what I was doing but thanks to the Internet and YouTube I was able to hack up whatever I wanted.

Immediately following high school I sort of fell out of web design. I found a bunch of other hobbies and got caught up with University studies and friends and the stress of keeping my grades up and switching majors every other semester because I had no idea what I wanted to do when I grew up.

Eventually I dropped out and moved to Vegas to try and "find myself" and make some money in the mean time.

One day I came across an ad for TeamTreeHouse and got a sort of weird euphoric flashback to the days I used to code.



I hadn't realized hard far web development had come and, as stupid as it sounds, never realized you could do it for a living. You could probably say I was distracted by trying to be an adult I completely forgot about my childhood obsession.

Fast forward EVEN FURTHER to now...



I have been teaching myself Web Development for about a year now and I am completely in love with it. It is mind boggling thinking of all the possibilities you can do when you know how to talk to a computer and tell it exactly what to do. You can reach an audience of any size and connect with them through a similar passion for something, or maybe a problem that you can help them solve.

All in all, its really sparked something in me that nothing else has been able to spark before, and I'm excited to venture down the rabbit hole that is Software Development and can't wait to come out of the other side.
