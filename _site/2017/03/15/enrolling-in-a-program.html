  <div class="post-line"></div>

  <p>This has been something in the back of my mind for a long time.</p>

<p>I’ve been teaching myself web development for about 8 months now and I think I’ve made tremendous progress on my own. I’ve been able to complete multiple tutorials, build up my portfolio with a few small projects, and I’ve really started to grasp the fundamentals of programming.</p>

<p>I’ve been able to make decent connections with a few meetups in my area, but my learning support system is not as strong as I would like it to be. I needed something to give me that extra push down the final stretch of my development journey and I decided that I needed to complete a serious curriculum.</p>

<p>Given my situation, the only feasible way to complete a course was through a learn at-your-own online program. After a ton of research, I narrowed it down to two programs: Flatiron School’s Learn Verified and The Firehose Project.</p>

<p>I was able to test both of the platforms and I highly favored LV over TFP, both design-wise and teaching style. Although, I did really like the fact that TFP included a personal mentor and an agile project at the end.</p>

<p>But what stood out to me about Learn was the ability to ask a question at anytime through the universal chat that messaged all staff-mentors and other LV students. Whenever I got stuck I would always have my questions answered through there within (at the very latest) the hour. Also, the Job Guarantee they offer was pretty cool.</p>

<p>I’m hoping my prior experience will propel me through the program and I’ll have a ton more experience to show employers. I should be starting in the next week and I’ll be sure to update shortly after.</p>
