  <h1 class="post-title">Tracking My Hikes With A Rails App</h1>
  <div class="post-line"></div>

  <p>Hiking is one of my favorite hobbies, along with just being outside in general. For my first big Rails project, I wanted to take an activity I really enjoy and quantify the data for other users to see.</p>

<p>This application is built completely with Ruby on Rails, using Devise for user authentication, and bootstrap for the front-end.</p>

<p>The application consists of 3 main models, Users, Trails, and Hikes. The Hike model serves as a join table for a User and a Trail. The application keeps track of a Users Hikes along with their total distance hiked, and total elevation climbed.</p>

<p>To make use of nested resources, I nested all hike creation aspects inside of the trail resource, because why would you created a hike without having a trail to hike anyway? This way, during the creation of the hike, I can keep tabs on the trail_id throughout the process.</p>

<p>To make use of class-level methods we have categories for the most active hiker (most hikes under their belt), the rock climber (highest elevation), and the trail-runner (longest distance hiked) that dynamically change according to who holds those current records.</p>

<p>Thanks to Devise, user authentication was very simple and straight forward. Devise also comes wth everything needed to provide OmniAuth login via Facebook and any other social login.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun on this project because hiking/exercising is something I really enjoy doing, so I wanted to make sure this app had all the features I would want when using an outdoor hike tracker.</p>

<p>In the near future I would like to update the app to have the ability to upload photos for each trail, have a comment/discussion section for each trail, and maybe even a dynamic leaderboard (possible addition for the jQuery front end section?).</p>
