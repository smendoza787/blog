<p>I come to you today as a changed man. A Ruby programmer that has been to the gates of Mordor and beyond, and lived to tell the tale.</p>

<p>But seriously, my brain hurts. While perusing through the Indeed pages looking for potential dream jobs and came across a posting where I felt confident enough to apply. They needed someone passionate about code and willing to learn new things. I thought I fit those requirements quite well.</p>

<p>Not long after applying I was happy to receive an email letting me know they were interested in learning more about me for the position, and sent over Part 1 of a 2-part coding challenge, and what a doozy it was.</p>

<p>The first part of the challenge involved building out fizzbuzz in the Haskell functional programming language. And that was only the first one. It seemed like a daunting task at first. I had seen Haskell before, during the early stages of my programming career and found it to be intruiging, but far too advanced for my skill level. Little did I know I would have to figure it out for a job application!</p>

<p>At first I had no idea what I was doing. I found a free book online called “Learn You a Haskell For Great Good!” and found it to be hilariously engaging. The author did a great job at explaining the basic concepts, but I did not have a few weeks to sit around and read the whole thing. This was a coding challenge and I told myself I had no other choice but to complete it by the end of the weekend. Which is when the frustration began…</p>

<p>I could not for the life of me figure out List Comprehensions and having to declare values before you even write the function. I was so used to Ruby and JavaScript doing all that for me implicitly and I took it all for granted!</p>

<p>After a few hours of Googling far and wide, I found a few stack overflow posts that were able to walk me through the functions I needed. My goal was to not comprehend the language as a whole, yet, but just enough to complete my challenge. I ended up hacking together a decent piece of code that was able to take in 3 variables, 2 for the FIZZ and BUZZ divisors, and the 3rd being the Upper bound of the range of numbers to be printed.</p>

<p>After being on a decent coding high from finally figuring out what I thought I was completely incapable of moments before, it was time to move onto the next challenge. The challenge involved solving for a palindrome (a word/phrase that is spelled the same backwards and forwards). A string would be passed to the program via Command Line Argument, if a palindrome was found, it needed to be returned in reverse lexical order. I had a couple choices of dynamically typed languages, I chose Python. Python had some pretty friendly syntax, not too far from Ruby, and it was actually the very first language I was exposed to in programming. Needless to say I knocked out that challenge within an hour.</p>

<p>I was required to complete the palindrome challenge in another, statically typed language. I ended up choosing Rust to work with. It reminded me alot of learning C during the Harvard CS course. You needed to declare value types for every function, and everything needed to be thrown in a main function. Rust documentation and Stack Overflow were my best friend for this challenge. And I think completing it made my brain grow 2 sizes that day.</p>

<p>Those were the main 3 challenges I had to complete, but there were “extra credit” challenges offered to complete, and who would I be without trying to take a stab at them.</p>

<p>The last challenge involved a bit of everything. Taking in a text file path via command line arguments, parsing the file of text line by line, and checking each line for a palindrome. If it was a palindrome, return “AY “ followed by the palindrome in reverse lexical order. If it was not, return “NAY “ and also returning the word in reverse lexical order. I ended up using Swift for the project because I had always been intrigued, and of course in awe of anything made by Apple.</p>

<p>8 hours later (according to my WakaTime summary) I was able to complete all the challenges along with some extra credit. I ended up having a pretty gnarly headache (LOL) by the end of it, but I’m so glad I finished it. I thought about giving up a couple times because I had no idea what I was doing but I refused to give up. I knew there was a way to work through the frustration and I found a groove between taking some breaks of fresh air and letting my mind absorb what I was trying to learn. It was a great experience and I can’t wait to devote more of my time to learning these new (to me) languages in the future.</p>
