  <h1 class="post-title">Making Connections in Faraway Places</h1>
  <div class="post-line"></div>

  <p>I knew networking would be tough. Probably even tougher than learning to code in the first place. Never have I ever felt extremely comfortable talking about myself, let alone highlighting my accomplishments and accolades I’ve received. I would much rather hear someone else speak about the things they’ve accomplished and inspired others to do.</p>

<p>So I’m in a very interesting and exciting situation at the moment. I’m originally from sunny Los Angeles CA, and a few years ago moved to EVEN SUNNIER Las Vegas NV. It’s been a fun time here in the good ol’ desert, but I’m really keen on moving to bigger and better things (and more tolerable weather).</p>

<p>So now I’m faced with quite the predicament. How am I supposed to build a network in a place where I know virtually no one? My initial thought was to try and plan a few turnaround trips around some of the <em>many</em> local Meetups that are hosted by startups in Denver, but I knew that wouldn’t be financially feasible (although I’m still strongly considering it because I’ll take any excuse to fly out to the Rockies).</p>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>I wanted to write this post to cover some of the things I have been doing to build my network remotely, in hopes that someone who finds themselves in a similar situation can benefit and start opening up more opportunities to other places besides their current city.</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<p>Before I get into it, I wanted to mention a few tools that I highly recommend for making contacts online. I’m sure there are a ton of resources, but these are programs I’ve found really helpful:</p>

<h3 id="linkedin"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a></h3>
<p>Pretty self-explanatory. LinkedIn is a social networking site specifically geared towards helping people make professional connections. If you don’t have one I suggest you take a nice-looking photo of your beautiful face, and create a profile so you can exponentially raise your chances at getting noticed and taken seriously.</p>

<h3 id="mailspring"><a href="https://getmailspring.com/">Mailspring</a></h3>
<p>The only mail client I’ve used since I’ve discovered it. Mailspring is awesome because comes with great organizational tools when it comes to email, like snoozing emails to a later date, sending emails at a scheduled time, and read receipt notifications. The read receipts might be a little weird, but I think it helps a lot in terms of finding out which people have been paying more attention to you.</p>

<h3 id="trello"><a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a></h3>
<p>Trello has been a swiss army knife of organizational tools for me. I use it every time I start a new project, or when I have a sudden bout of inspiration. In regards to networking, its helped me organize everything I’ve found about a person (email, github, portfolio site) into a simple snapshot that I can add, edit, and rearrange.</p>

<h3 id="github"><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a></h3>
<p>Looking at other people’s code helps tremendously when learning to code, and also helps when trying to learn more about a person. Since we are trying to reach out to other developers, its nice to be able to look at some of their work to get a better sense of who they are, and what they like to work on. It’s also a great conversation starter! Maybe one of the projects they worked on resonated with you, and would be a great talking point to bring up.</p>

<h3 id="google-calendarhangouts"><a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">Google Calendar/Hangouts</a></h3>
<p>The easiest no-brainer solution for scheduling networking meetings. Once you’re able to agree upon a time with someone, its as simple as adding the event to your Google Calendar, and adding the persons email to the event to automatically schedule a Hangout.</p>

<h2 id="finding-people-to-reach-out-to">Finding People to Reach Out To</h2>

<p>Ideally, it’s pretty simple to network in your own city. Meetup.com has a ton of resources for finding people with similar interests as you. The hardest part is probably finding the right Meetup that aligns with your schedule. After that, all you need to do is show up.</p>

<p>Networking in a city hundreds of miles away, however, isn’t so easy because you don’t have immediate access to networking events like Meetups. So what can you do?</p>

<p>Luckily there are great websites liked <a href="https://linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> that are designed to make networking remotely as easy as possible. I decided to try and come up with a system for getting people to notice me and at least entertain the thought of having a conversation with my over a Google Hangout. I’m currently a bartender by trade, so talking to people and making new friends was something I was really fortunate to be able to practice every day. And I love doing it! Everyone has a different personality, a different story to tell and a mix of qualities and hobbies that make up who they are. I’ve always been fascinated by the way people tick and would spend hours listening to someone talk about their own lives.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-list-of-interesting-people">Create A List of Interesting People</h2>

<p>I rely heavily on job-posting sites to find places that are hiring, and dig a little bit deeper into the company to find out what its like to work there. Is this somewhere I can grow? Will I be overwhelmed? What type of background do their current employees have?</p>

<p>Once I’ve found some cool-looking companies, I use LinkedIn to find every developer that works there. I poke around their Github and Portfolio pages to get a good sense of who they are, and then I write my email.</p>

<h2 id="writing-outreach-emails">Writing Outreach Emails</h2>

<p>Now I’ve never really networked before, so the only way I know how to talk to people is to just be friendly. If they had a project I thought was really cool, I’ll let them know that in my email. Maybe they used a technology that I’ve never used but always wanted to learn. Maybe one of their apps solved a problem that I could never find the solution to. Developers are awesome people that get to make really cool things, so I’ve never found a shortage of things to talk about!</p>

<p>As long as you state who you are, why you are reaching out to them, and let them know of your intentions honestly, writing outreach emails is just a nice friendly way of reaching out to compliment the person and say hello.</p>

<h2 id="the-google-hangout">The Google Hangout</h2>

<p>Once you’re able to schedule a meeting with them, the hard part is over. Make sure you’re a little early to your meeting as to not keep the other person waiting.</p>

<p>I think people love getting asked about how they were able to accomplish something. It gives them a chance to reflect on their past, and they could potentially share invaluable peices of information that will help you out.</p>

<p>I’ve found that a good way to get things going is to ask how the person got into development. What was the first program they wrote? What was their first job and how did they get the opportunity? After all, you’re looking to find your first development job and you could use a few tips.</p>

<p>After having a nice chat, its always good to close the conversation with an ask that you could take action on. I usually ask if the person knows anyone else that would be willing to have a short chat with me. You could also ask if they recommend any companies to look out for, which just gives you another list of potential people to network with.</p>

<h2 id="continuing-the-conversation">Continuing the Conversation</h2>

<p>After you’ve had your first successful networking meeting, its always nice to write a thank you email, and mention something that you talked about in conversation. Maybe you talked about a new framework coming out, its nice to send over a nice blog post or video about that framework that you think the person would benefit from.</p>

<p>Maybe later on down the line you find yourself getting into a new technology or project. I’ll usually write my contacts asking if they have experience with that technology, or know somebody that does. Its a nice way to rekindle a conversation, and spark up a new one that could lead to many more conversations.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The main takeaway I’d like to leave you with is this: just make friends. Reaching out to people for the sole purpose of finding a job might come off as ingenuine, and won’t let you really connect with someone on a deep level because you’ll always have your own agenda in the back of your mind. As long as you think of networking as just a cool excuse to meet new people, make new friends or learn from strangers, you’ll have a really easy time making long-lasting connections that will extend far beyond the world of software development.</p>
