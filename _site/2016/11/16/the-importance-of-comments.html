  <h1 class="post-title">Realizing the Importance of Comments</h1>
  <div class="post-line"></div>

  <p>Like the title states, comments are something I‚Äôve always overlooked while developing my applications. Partly because I had no intentions of going in to refactor my code anytime soon, and partly because I‚Äôm really lazy lol.</p>

<p>A few days ago I chose to end my streak of lazy-ness and made it a point to try to comment as much as I could. What does this line do? Why am I making this for loop right here? I tried to express as much as I possibly could and go into considerable detail. I‚Äôm trying ( üòÇ ) to become a better writer so the more I write, the better.</p>

<p>For me, comments are important because:</p>

<ol>
  <li>They allow your code to be a lot more readable, which is huge when it comes to refactoring/updating old code, or if you plan on sharing your code with others</li>
  <li>As you work through a problem it allows you to break down each section on the fly, so the problem is A LOT more clear than if you had just written plain code</li>
</ol>

<p>As I‚Äôm heading into the era of the job application process I thought it would make sense to clean up some old code. As I was opening up some ‚Äúold‚Äù projects on CodePen I realized it was going to be very difficult to understand why I implemented certain features or components in certain places. Writing why you did something can be a huge help later to understand what sort of mindset you were in while you were working.</p>

<p>Another huge help that comments provide is a way to work out the problem you are working on, on the fly. When I first started coding I would try to work out as much of the problem out in my head first, then pick at my mental results and translate it into code. After a few months of that, I was starting to realize it was probably the wrong way and there had to have been better methods.</p>

<p>After a little googling about developer workflows I came to the conclusion that most devs write out as much as they know about the problem FIRST, then break it down into comments, and code from there.</p>

<p>This has proved invaluable to me because I can use all of my focus on one particular problem, instead of trying to work everything out in my head a little at a time and eventually forgetting almost everything.</p>

<p>I plan on commenting throughout ALL (or at least most) of my code from here on out and hope to reach a level where my explanations are much shorter. (I‚Äôm still working on condensing my thoughts into shorter bits of info, I like to ramble üò¶ )</p>
