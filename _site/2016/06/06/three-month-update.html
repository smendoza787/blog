  <h1 class="post-title">Three Month Update</h1>
  <div class="post-line"></div>

  <p>So it has been about 3 months into my coding journey.</p>

<p>I would like to start off by saying I am having a blast learning to code, and I am beyond excited for the career and possible relocation opportunities that lie ahead. I have never felt so excited towards anything in my life, and that makes me feel amazing!</p>

<p>I had a rocky start at the beginning of my learning, I am afraid I was more interested in the “methods” of learning rather than learning the actual material. I guess I got a little bit of cold feet.</p>

<p>At first glance code looks SO intimidating. So many parenthesis and equal signs, astronomical looking numbers paired with so many different variables it literally made my head spin.</p>

<p>But as I am learning through the languages and immersing myself in everything tech, I am finding most concepts much easier to grasp. It gets a little frustrating coming into contact with your first bug or the first time your program doesn’t do exactly what you want it to do. But the wave of relief/excitement that you get when your program runs smoothly is so worth it!</p>

<p>I am learning more about myself and how to analyze every day situations as well. I never knew my habit of staying up until the wee hours relentlessly trying to get something on my computer to work would actually benefit me! Also, I think I am able to analyze situations in more detail. I can definitely feel my brain working harder and I love it.</p>

<p>I am still getting used to writing again since it has been about 4 years since I’ve been in school, but I am hoping to improve by just writing. No matter who ends up reading these, I can’t wait to check on my progress!</p>
