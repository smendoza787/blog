  <p>LEARN ALL THE THINGS!</p>

<p>For the past few weeks I have been immersing myself heavily into all things code.</p>

<p>If I’m not writing code, I’m reading about it. If I’m not reading or writing about it, I’m listening to the Learn to Code With Me podcast, JavaScript Jabber, CodeNewbie or one of the many other podcasts there are out there. I’m keeping up a constant stream of knowledge and everything is flowing beautifully.</p>

<p>I recently reached another mini milestone completing my Local Weather app through freecodecamp which proved to be quite the challenge.  I was having a tough time with nesting certain HTTP requests within certain functions, and had an even harder time deciding whether or not I should even nest the calls within a function. Should they be in the global scope? Should they be nested within a new or existing function? Should I call them? How many parameters should they accept? Should they take any parameters???</p>

<p>So many questions to answer, I went through what seemed like a mid life crisis trying to decide how to call those functions  within the program to make sure both APIs ran when they were supposed to.</p>

<p>I got so frustrated having all these conflicting thoughts and realized I hadn’t even written a line of code. Then I reminded myself of something that helped me throughout the project. Bad code is better than no code. (To what extent that may be true, I don’t really know. But humor me while I tell you that I used it as my mantra) To me that meant actually writing something to run rather than sit there scratching my head. I figured the worst thing that could happen is that it would not work, and even after that the JS console would be able to point me in some kind of direction. (Thank God for Chrome Dev Tools)</p>

<p>After sharing it on Reddit and the FCC forums I’ve also learned that it isn’t working for certain chrome browsers which is something I will look into when I go back in to clean things up (which I will, I know browser compatibility is something you can’t forgo in a serious project)</p>

<p>My next project will be building a wikipedia viewer. Users will be able to search for wikipedia articles, or choose to display a random wikipedia page. Before I even touch the project I suspect it will present even more of a challenge than the weather app because we’ll be dealing with user input. A user should be able to type anything regardless of case sensitivity and have wiki articles pop up. I plan on using Google and Chrome Dev Tools like there is no tomorrow since I have absolutely no clue how I’ll start, but trust me when I say I will get this done.</p>

<p>Below is the link to my Local Weather App, try it out and let me know what you think.</p>
