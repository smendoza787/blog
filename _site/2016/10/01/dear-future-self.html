  <h1 class="post-title">Dear Future Self,</h1>
  <div class="post-line"></div>

  <p>For the past couple days I’ve been sprinting through the first part of the Udacity FEND program like nobody’s business. One of the first projects was to write a letter to your future self, which you would then open whenever things got tough and weren’t necessarily going your way. I thought this was a really cool idea and I like how my letter came out, as I really got to dig a little deep and find out why I wanted to get into this industry so bad.</p>

<p>Here is my letter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Self,
Look at how far you’ve come. You’ve saturated your brain with so much
information for the past few weeks and you know about 10x more than you did just a few days ago! I am proud of you, but it looks like you’ve gotten yourself into a pickle. Just take a deep breath, and slow things down.
There must be a million solutions running through your head about the
current problem at hand, sometimes the best thing to do right now is
to…do something else for a bit. Walk away, listen to your favorite song, watch a funny video, anything to get your mind off the current frustrating track that you are currently riding and start somewhere fresh. Google is your best friend, there is no problem that you are going through that someone else hasn’t been through themselves. Just know that every time you fail, you are learning that much more. Now the next time you encounter this problem, you’ll have this memory to look back on and have your own special way of remembering/solving it.</p>

  <p>As someone that has been diving into the world of coding, I can’t express how much I would love to be a Front-End Developer. Every time I would find myself looking at great looking web pages and apps I wonder, “How did they do that? How did they learn to get the lines of their design so clean, it’s like they know exactly where to place certain elements so that I will want to keep looking through this page/app.” Then I would attempt to copy the design and fail miserably or end up making something that my dog could have made easily (lol) and get frustrated and give up. But through some sort of divine intervention the lure of web development has sucked me in ever-so slightly that I have now actually decided to take this journey seriously, and turn it into a career that I know I will love. I dream of the day I can wake up and actually create beautiful, responsive web pages that have amazing color schemes, cool effects and illustrations and be able to call that my own! I long to be one of the early (relatively) pioneers of the internet, and I want to make a difference, I can’t wait.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My letter was reviewed by a developer by Udacity and they were able to provide some great feedback for me. It’s nice to know that I am not in this journey alone. And I feel like every little crevice of the coding community I uncover has been nothing but welcoming to me, and I can’t wait until I have acquired enough skill to help someone else and maybe pave a little part of the way for that person to follow their dreams!</p>
