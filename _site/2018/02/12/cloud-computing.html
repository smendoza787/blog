  <h1 class="post-title">What's Up With Cloud Computing?</h1>
  <div class="post-line"></div>

  <p>If I could choose a buzzword of the century in regards to software development, it would have to be the “cloud”.</p>

<p>Nowadays it seems as though everyone is migrating to the cloud, or at least should be. But what does “moving to the cloud” actually mean?</p>

<h1 id="problems-with-a-traditional-server-setup">Problems With A Traditional Server Setup</h1>

<p>In the golden days of the web, most people would host their application on a server. Whether that server was their own machine, a server setup in their nearby closet, or rented space from a server provider; that server would have to be kept running and maintained 24/7 in order to keep their application serving content across the web.</p>

<p>Depending on your circumstance and the scale of your application, this process could prove to be costly and time-consuming. What would happen if that server were to go down for some reason. Would you have access to a backup server while you performed maintenance? Do you or anyone you know have the skills to troubleshoot a downed server? If you were renting a server from a 3rd-party company, would they have the kind of customer service where you could call and have someone fix your issue?</p>

<p>These are just some of the problems, along with a plethora of others, that could arise when working with a traditional server setup.</p>

<h1 id="enter-the-cloud">Enter The Cloud!</h1>

<p>Cloud computing has introduced a way for giant tech companies (a la Amazon, Microsoft, etc.) to provide consumers with a cost-efficient way to access massive amounts of high-quality servers. Amazon in particular launched Amazon Web Services in 2004 to provide customers with an array of services for everyone’s needs from running an OS-agnostic virtual machine with AWS EC2, to serving up static content with AWS S3.</p>

<p>But why are so many people moving to the cloud? Turns out that there are a ton of benefits for small and large companies alike. In particular, it levels the playing field for smaller companies to harness the benefits of powerful server technology and compete with large-scale enterprise companies.</p>

<p>Let’s run through some of the benefits of the cloud and why you should consider migrating your application to cloud-based services:</p>

<h2 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If your application goes through a fluctuation of bandwidth demands, a cloud service would highly benefit you by providing you with the capability to scale up your capacity on-demand. At the same time, if your business needs happen to decrease, you can easily scale down your services to save a little cash. The flexibility and automation of the cloud can really help you save money, and meet the demand of your customers when you really need it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="disaster-recovery">Disaster Recovery</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In the unfortunate event that something happens to your data, having a system in place to recover that data as quickly as possible should be at the top of your list. Up until recently, smaller businesses would have to spend additional resources in order to get the expertise and knowledge needed to recover their data. Cloud services have baked recovery right into their systems in order to aid businesses in recovering their information faster than ever before with less overhead.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="software-updates">Software Updates</h2>
<p>Having your servers off-site and out-of-mind has the extreme benefit not having to be responsible for maintaining the integrity of your systems. Cloud providers take care of all the nitty-gritty software updates so you can focus on developing your product rather than meticulously maintaining it.</p>

<h2 id="high-cost-avoidance">High-Cost Avoidance</h2>
<p>Cloud computing allows you to avoid the high costs of purchasing high-quality hardware and the headaches that come with it. Just pick your plan and pay-as-you-go!</p>

<h2 id="increased-collaboration">Increased Collaboration</h2>
<p>Cloud computing puts all of your teams work in one central repository that everyone on your team has access to wherever they are. This greatly improves workflow and allows full visibility across your team.</p>

<h2 id="competitiveness">Competitiveness</h2>
<p>Moving to the cloud allows companies of any size access to enterprise-level technology so even small businesses can compete with giants.</p>

<p>As a newbie coming into the cloud computing world, these are just some of the massive benefits I’ve found when I asked myself the question: what’s the big deal with cloud computing? As I dive deeper into the cloud space I’m sure I’ll find even more benefits to migrating applications to the cloud.</p>

<p>I hope you found this post useful and use it to convince yourself or others to start making the move into the cloud!</p>
