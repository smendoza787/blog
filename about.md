Having been in the hospitality industry for the past 10 years, I'm proud to say that I've helped create thousands of memorable experiences for people. After falling in love with Web Development and learning how to build full stack web applications, I am having an amazing time transitioning my skills into creating beautiful and intuitive digital user experiences.

I've had an insatiable passion for technology for as long as I can remember. From creating custom MySpace layouts for friends in high-school, to creating my own custom Photoshop brushes for my Xanga page, my passions have always surrounded expressing my creativity in tech.

Since then I've completed the Full Stack Web Developer program at the Flatiron School where I've developed skills in Ruby on Rails, SQL, JavaScript, React and Redux by building out personal projects that involve some of my other many hobbies.

With my first developer job I am looking forward to deepening my knowledge of the React/Redux ecosystem, and working with an awesome team of developers to deliver a product that will solve real problems for real people.
